# The Dawn of a New Era

Astro represents a paradigm shift in web development. By shipping **zero JavaScript by default**, it delivers lightning-fast websites that users love.

## Why Astro?

### 1. Island Architecture

Components are isolated islands of interactivity in a sea of static HTML. This means:

- Faster page loads
- Better SEO
- Improved user experience

### 2. Framework Agnostic

Use React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS - Astro doesn't care. Mix and match as you please.

### 3. Content-First

Built with content sites in mind. Markdown, MDX, and content collections make managing content a breeze.

## The Performance Revolution

```javascript
// Traditional SPA: Ships entire framework
import HeavyFramework from 'heavy-framework';

// Astro: Ships only what's needed
// Zero JS by default!
```

Astro sites consistently score **100 on Lighthouse** because they prioritize what matters: delivering content fast.

## Join the Movement

The future of web development is here. Are you ready to embrace it?
